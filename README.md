## Introduction

Bitcoin_Wallet_REST_API is a simple Bitcoin Wallet REST API based on a simplified Bitcoin transaction model.

## Features

- API endpoint  1: /listTransactions will provide JSON data of all the transactions that are stored in the database.
- API endpoint  2: /showBalance will provide JSON data of the balance that is usable in the current account.
- API endpoint  3: /spendBalance?amount=[insert number] will "spend" x amount of euros from the account.

## Installation

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/GitGert/Bitcoin_Wallet_REST_API
```

## Usage

In order to run the application you will need have [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) installed on your machine.

* navigate to the root folder:
``` bash
cd Bitcoin_Wallet_REST_API
```

* start the server:
``` bash
go run main.go
```
Golangs dependencies should resolve themselves when running "main.go" for the first time.
* to test you will need to either use a browser or a CLI tool like [cURL](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/curl-command)

API ENDPOINT LINKS:
- http://localhost:8080/listTransactions
- http://localhost:8080/showBalance
- http://localhost:8080/spendBalance?amount=100

you can change the amount of euros you wish to spend by changing the number
after "/spendBalance?amount="

* in order to add funds connect to the database:
```sql
sqlite3 bitcoin_wallet.db
```
* and paste the query:
```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (id, amount, spent, created_at) VALUES (
    'a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5',
    10.0,
    0,
    '1000-01-01 00:00:00'
);
```
